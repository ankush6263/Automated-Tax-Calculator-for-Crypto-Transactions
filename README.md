# Automated Tax Calculator for Crypto Transactions

## Project Description
This smart contract simplifies crypto tax calculations by automatically determining tax liabilities based on a fixed rate and transaction amount. Designed for individuals and businesses engaging in crypto transactions, it allows users to get real-time tax values in a decentralized, trustless manner.

## Project Vision
To streamline and automate tax reporting in decentralized environments, helping crypto users stay compliant with taxation regulations in a transparent and tamper-proof way.

## Key Features
- âœ… Simple tax calculation based on transaction amount and dynamic tax rate.
- âœ… Owner-only tax rate configuration.
- âœ… Emits events for each transaction for easy off-chain tracking and integration.
  
## Future Scope
- ðŸ›  Integration with real-time crypto price oracles to support fiat-equivalent tax calculations.
- ðŸ›  Multi-rate tax logic (e.g., based on transaction type or wallet type).
- ðŸ›  Full integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to calculate tax at the moment of trade.
- ðŸ›  User-friendly frontend DApp for tax tracking and export.
